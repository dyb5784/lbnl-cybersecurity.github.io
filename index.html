      <p>Can synchronized distribution level phasor measurements enhance planning for power flow and system control, security and resiliency in the modernized grid?</p>

      <p>By installing a number of µPMUs in various locations in the electric distribution system and evaluating the data from them, the project aims to determine whether refined measurement of voltage phase angles can enable advanced diagnostic, monitoring and control methodologies in distribution systems, and to begin developing algorithms for diagnostic applications based on µPMU data.</p>

      <p>Applications being studied include:</p>
       <ul>
         <LI> State estimation and enhanced visibility for distribution system operators </LI>
         <LI> Characterization of loads and distributed generation</LI>
         <LI> Diagnosis of potentially problematic conditions such as oscillations or FIDVR</LI>
         <LI> Microgrid synchronization</LI>
	       <LI> Cybersecurity of power distribution grid equipment</LI>
      </ul>

<p>The dataset stored at https://powerdata-explore.lbl.gov is a set of power measurements and annotations, and an interface for exploring and downloading that data. The power measurements are collected by micro-phasor measurement units (μPMUs) and PQube3 power quality meters manufactured by Power Standards Laboratory in Alameda, CA and located at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, as well as other sites. The data located at https://powerdata-explore.lbl.gov is collected by PQube3s and μPMUs installed and used initially for a variety of purposes.

<p>This LBNL dataset is available for the research public to use and download.
